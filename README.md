The intent of the project was to build a Revolutionary API builder, user management, analytics and management platform, powering apignite.com.
This proof of concept was to have something read PHP classes and parse out functions and parameters, then output it to a database that could be manipulated through a UI. A very rough class parser and UI were put together to show what else could be built out, but it's by no means functional or feature complete, just a proof of concept. Also, the code is quite dirty, there were 2 other contributors who jumped on the project and contributed as part of the 24 hour TechCrunch NY hackathon 2012. Perhaps someone will find elements of this useful or perhaps it's utter garbage :)

Make sure that you update the config/database.php with your credentials.
